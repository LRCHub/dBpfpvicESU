[Bonus track, Europe]

And here i came last night
Was it a waking dream in me?
The spiral staircase led to places so unknown

And out of a clear sky falling
I'm searching high and low for hold
Right on the brink of ruin

[Chorus]
If i could hear your calls
Reflected to the nines
Revealing precious memories
The whispering gallery
The place of mystery
In echoes from a silent sea

And there the shadows danced
Before i heard the clarion call
In their centennial desperation i won't fall

Shaken to their foundations
A mereghost of their former selves
Well nigh they've gone to glory

[Chorus]

There's a sign in constant glory
Will it be my guiding star
On the floatbridge to forever
I can go on so far
This alluring jack o' lantern
And the relics of the past
Leading on to your decay
The pendulum swings so fast

[Bridge]
On the gateway to your mind
On the flare path of your magnificient
Prettifying dreams
It's the touchstone of mankind
It's the only truth to find

[Chorus]
