Here we are at the gallery of the grotesque
Come a little closer just a few more steps
As we enter now we see the neophyte of life
Looking for the savior living on the knife

Chorus:
Gallery of the grotesque
Where your fears are brought from rest
Grotesque
Gallery of the grotesque strength survives this fatal test
Grotesque

Feel the rhythm pounding on madly through your veins
Are you willing to come with me to go insane
Who here will try to die, no echo, no last goodbye
Psychic Revelations

Welcome to your death

There we were at the gallery of the grotesque
What's alive inside your brain, you can leave
Won't you play my game
In your room, dream
Too much blood, scream
What's out there

Repeat Chorus
